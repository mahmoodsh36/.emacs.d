Keeping a list of all the explicitly installed packages can be useful, to backup a system for example or speed up installation on a new system:

$ pacman -Qqe > pkglist.txt

from url: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages


However, it is likely foreign packages such as from the AUR or installed locally are present in the list. To filter out from the list the foreign packages, the previous command line can be enriched as follows:

# pacman -S --needed $(comm -12 <(pacman -Slq | sort) <(sort pkglist.txt))

Eventually, to make sure the installed packages of your system match the list and remove all the packages that are not mentioned in it:

# pacman -Rsu $(comm -23 <(pacman -Qq | sort) <(sort pkglist.txt))

the only reason i backup inputrc because it has the 2 lines that allow me to use vim mode in terminal


to load gnome dconf settings do 
dconf load / < gnome-dconf.txt

dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/ > gnome-terminal-profiles.dconf
